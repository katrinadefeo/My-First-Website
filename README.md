# My-First-Website

Behold! My very first full website that I did for class. It contains some php and some SQL but you don't need it to login. You can just straight up look at the individual pages. Looking at it now I'm amazed by how I could actually think it looked good. But I like to keep it around to show my progress and remember how much fun I had making it. I didn't follow a lot of best practices when it came to making it and it is super messy, but I'll still keep it around to look back at. It's all Lord of the Rings themed so have fun looking at pictures and listening to music.
